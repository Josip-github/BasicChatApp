This repository contains a rudimentary chat application, where users can submit messages along with their username, and those messages will be visible to any user that navigates to /chat URL. Additionally, users are able to select a message "mode": either Say, Shout, or Whisper. "Say" should display the message as written, while "Shout" should display the message in all-uppercase, and "Whisper" should display the message in all-lowercase.
